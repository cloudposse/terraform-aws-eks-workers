Terraform module to provision AWS resources to run EC2 worker nodes for [Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

Instantiate it multiple times to create many EKS worker node pools with specific settings such as GPUs, EC2 instance types, or autoscale parameters.

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 






## Introduction

The module provisions the following resources:

- IAM Role and Instance Profile to allow Kubernetes nodes to access other AWS services
- Security Group with rules for EKS workers to allow networking traffic
- AutoScaling Group with Launch Template to configure and launch worker instances
- AutoScaling Policies and CloudWatch Metric Alarms to monitor CPU utilization on the EC2 instances and scale the number of instance in the AutoScaling Group up or down.
If you don't want to use the provided functionality, or want to provide your own policies, disable it by setting the variable `autoscaling_policies_enabled` to `"false"`.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-workers/releases).
