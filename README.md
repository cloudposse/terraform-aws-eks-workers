Terraform module to provision AWS resources to run EC2 worker nodes for [Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

Instantiate it multiple times to create many EKS worker node pools with specific settings such as GPUs, EC2 instance types, or autoscale parameters.

We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!






## Introduction

The module provisions the following resources:

- IAM Role and Instance Profile to allow Kubernetes nodes to access other AWS services
- Security Group with rules for EKS workers to allow networking traffic
- AutoScaling Group with Launch Template to configure and launch worker instances
- AutoScaling Policies and CloudWatch Metric Alarms to monitor CPU utilization on the EC2 instances and scale the number of instance in the AutoScaling Group up or down.
If you don't want to use the provided functionality, or want to provide your own policies, disable it by setting the variable `autoscaling_policies_enabled` to `"false"`.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.

| subnet\_ids | A list of subnet IDs to launch resources in | `list(string)` | n/a | yes |
| suspended\_processes | A list of processes to suspend for the AutoScaling Group. The allowed values are `Launch`, `Terminate`, `HealthCheck`, `ReplaceUnhealthy`, `AZRebalance`, `AlarmNotification`, `ScheduledActions`, `AddToLoadBalancer`. Note that if you suspend either the `Launch` or `Terminate` process types, it can prevent your autoscaling group from functioning properly. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. `map('BusinessUnit','XYZ')` | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| target\_group\_arns | A list of aws\_alb\_target\_group ARNs, for use with Application Load Balancing | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| termination\_policies | A list of policies to decide how the instances in the auto scale group should be terminated. The allowed values are `OldestInstance`, `NewestInstance`, `OldestLaunchConfiguration`, `ClosestToNextInstanceHour`, `Default` | `list(string)` | <pre>[<br>  "Default"<br>]</pre> | no |
| use\_custom\_image\_id | If set to `true`, will use variable `image_id` for the EKS workers inside autoscaling group | `bool` | `false` | no |
| use\_existing\_aws\_iam\_instance\_profile | If set to `true`, will use variable `aws_iam_instance_profile_name` to run EKS workers using an existing AWS instance profile that was created outside of this module, workaround for error like `count cannot be computed` | `bool` | `false` | no |
| use\_existing\_security\_group | If set to `true`, will use variable `workers_security_group_id` to run EKS workers using an existing security group that was created outside of this module, workaround for errors like `count cannot be computed` | `bool` | `false` | no |
| vpc\_id | VPC ID for the EKS cluster | `string` | n/a | yes |
| wait\_for\_capacity\_timeout | A maximum duration that Terraform should wait for ASG instances to be healthy before timing out. Setting this to '0' causes Terraform to skip all Capacity Waiting behavior | `string` | `"10m"` | no |
| wait\_for\_elb\_capacity | Setting this will cause Terraform to wait for exactly this number of healthy instances in all attached load balancers on both create and update operations. Takes precedence over `min_elb_capacity` behavior | `number` | `0` | no |
| workers\_role\_policy\_arns | List of policy ARNs that will be attached to the workers default role on creation | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| workers\_role\_policy\_arns\_count | Count of policy ARNs that will be attached to the workers default role on creation. Needed to prevent Terraform error `count can't be computed` | `number` | `0` | no |
| workers\_security\_group\_id | The name of the existing security group that will be used in autoscaling group for EKS workers. If empty, a new security group will be created | `string` | `""` | no |
