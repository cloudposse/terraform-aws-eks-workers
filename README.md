# terraform-aws-eks-workers [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-workers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-workers) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-workers.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-workers/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision AWS resources to run EC2 worker nodes for [Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).









## Introduction

The module provisions the following resources:

- IAM Role and Instance Profile to allow Kubernetes nodes to access other AWS services
- Security Group with rules for EKS workers to allow networking traffic
- AutoScaling Group with Launch Template to configure and launch worker instances
- AutoScaling Policies and CloudWatch Metric Alarms to monitor CPU utilization on the EC2 instances and scale the number of instance in the AutoScaling Group up or down.
If you don't want to use the provided functionality, or want to provide your own policies, disable it by setting the variable `autoscaling_policies_enabled` to `"false"`.

The allowed values are `Launch`, `Terminate`, `HealthCheck`, `ReplaceUnhealthy`, `AZRebalance`, `AlarmNotification`, `ScheduledActions`, `AddToLoadBalancer`.

| wait_for_elb_capacity | Setting this will cause Terraform to wait for exactly this number of healthy instances in all attached load balancers on both create and update operations. Takes precedence over `min_elb_capacity` behavior | string | `false` | no |
